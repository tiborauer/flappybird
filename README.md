# Flappybird based on PsychToolBox

(based on [Mingjing Zhang's flappybird-for-matlab](https://github.com/mingjingz/flappybird-for-matlab))

#### Author: Tibor Auer

As one of the most popular games on app stores before being taken down, Flappy Bird does not need any further introduction. Now, it has come back alive, on MATLAB based on PsychToolBox-3. 
The main intention is to use for neurofeedback visualisation.

This implementation has been slightly modified and several parameters are available to tweak the game physics.

*It has been tested in MATLAB R2018b and PsychToolBox 3.0.15 (8 November 2018).

## Usage:
Simply execute FlappyBird.m.

## Control:
Mouse position above the threshold shown on the left -> Jump/Start game; 

** If you encounter any problem, or have any suggestions / feedbacks, please drop a comment down below. **

Enjoy the endless flapping!
